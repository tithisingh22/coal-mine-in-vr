Development Of VR/AR (Virtual Reality/ Augmented
Reality)
Based Application To Train And Upskill The Workforce
Involved In Safely Executing High Risk Tasks And
Problem solving Key Operational Challenges In Coal
Mining Industry
Coal mine safety training and emergency drills are effective measures to prevent disasters and accidents. At this
stage, however, there are problems such as the boring training content, drills emphasizing “performance” rather
than “practice”
, and formalism.
Metaverse technology integrates VR, AR, 3D, Internet of things, AI and other technologies, therefore, it is
characterized by intuitiveness, strong interaction and high knowledge conversion rate in coal mine safety
training and emergency drills, which can well solve the above problems.
With the continuous promotion of smart mines and the development of the metaverse technology, it will
eventually provide a new way for safety training and emergency drills in coal mines and non-coal mines.
